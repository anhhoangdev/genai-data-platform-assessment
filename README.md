## 📌 About This Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the GenAI-powered technical assessment, covering key infrastructure and data engineering tasks. Each task demonstrates:

- 🔍 System design and architectural planning
- 🤖 Effective use of GenAI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Windsurf, Cursor)
- 🧠 Analytical thinking and tradeoff evaluation
- 📝 Clear, structured documentation and rationale

---

## ✅ Focused Tasks

| Task Code | Name | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **A01** | DevOps Architect | Build a secure, scalable GCP infrastructure using Terraform, IAM, NFS, FreeIPA |
| **A02** | Data Infra Engineer | Design a scalable Python compute cluster (Dask-based) with autoscaling and monitoring |
| **B01** | Vector DB Tutorial | Write a comprehensive tutorial on vector databases (definitions, tools, implementation, best practices) |

> 📌 Each task includes:
> - 📄 `report_*.md`: Technical report
> - 💬 `report_*.prompt.md`: Prompt + GenAI usage log
> - 🖼️ `/diagrams`: Diagrams and architecture visuals (where relevant)

## 🧠 GenAI Tooling Philosophy

GenAI tools were used not for raw generation, but to support:
- 🔍 Research comparisons (e.g., Dask vs Ray, IAM structures)
- 🛠️ Code scaffolding (Terraform modules, cluster configs)
- ✍️ Documentation polishing and knowledge summarization
- 🗂️ Workflow planning & task breakdown (Cursor,)
