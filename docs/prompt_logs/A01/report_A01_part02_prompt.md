> ## COSTS & KPIs
> 
> * **Total Monthly Cost**: \$2,824
> * **Per User Cost**: \$94–141/month
> * **SLA Targets**: 99.9% uptime, <2s auth response
> * **KPIs**: Zero-downtime deployment, security compliance, automation coverage
> 
> 
> ## CURRENT GAPS
> 
> * Missing Mermaid diagrams:
> 
>   * **architecture.mmd** — System topology + components
>   * **integration\_flow\.mmd** — Auth/NFS + service interactions
>   * **coordination\_workflow\.mmd** — Terraform + Ansible execution order
>   * **exec\_overview\.mmd** — Simplified stakeholder-friendly view
>   * **deployment\_timeline.mmd** — Gantt chart of Phases 0–4
> * Deployment guide section in report is not modularized or linked to `.mmd` diagram
> * Diagram hooks and captions missing in `report_A01.md` and part files
> 
> 
> ## OBJECTIVES FOR CURSOR
> 
> 1. **Create Placeholder Diagram Files** in `docs/diagrams/A01/`:
> 
>    ```bash
>    mkdir -p docs/diagrams/A01
>    touch docs/diagrams/A01/{architecture.mmd,integration_flow.mmd,coordination_workflow.mmd,exec_overview.mmd,deployment_timeline.mmd}
>    ```
> 
>    Each file content:
> 
>    ```mermaid
>    %% TODO: Fill with actual diagram content
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Insert Diagram Hooks in Reports**:
> 
>    * `report_A01.md`, `report_A01_part01_architecture.md`, `report_A01_part02_deployment.md`, `report_A01_part03_operations.md`
>    * For each diagram, add:
> 
>      ````markdown
>      ### [Section Title]
>      ```mermaid
>      %% TODO: Link to corresponding .mmd file
>      ````
> 
>      **Technical Explanation**: \[TODO]
>      **Business Summary**: \[TODO]
> 
>      ```
>      ```
> 
> 3. **Scaffold Deployment Guide Section**:
> 
>    * Create a dedicated "Deployment Guide" section in `report_A01.md`
>    * Include:
> 
>      * Pre-deployment checklist placeholder
>      * Phase-by-phase instruction placeholders
>      * Validation checklist placeholders
>      * `[TODO: Insert Gantt chart here]` linking to `deployment_timeline.mmd`
> 
> 4. **Maintain Style Compliance**:
> 
>    * Follow `docs/ctx_doc_style.md`
>    * Dual-audience explanations for all diagrams
>    * Use existing terminology from current report
> 
> 5. **DO NOT Generate Real Content**:
> 
>    * No diagrams
>    * No rewriting of existing deployment commands or architecture
>    * Only create **placeholders, hooks, and file structure**
> 
> 
> ## EXECUTION ORDER
> 
> 1. Read:
> 
>    * `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
>    * `memory-bank/techContext.md`
>    * `docs/reports/A01/report_A01.md`
> 2. Create `.md` placeholders in `docs/diagrams/A01/`
> 3. Insert hooks in report and part files
> 4. Scaffold deployment guide structure
> 5. Commit changes

> ## FOLLOW-UP TASK: Populate A01 Documentation as Unified Report
> 
> ### CONTEXT
> - Current repo has `docs/reports/A01/report_A01.md` as main entry point with part files for architecture, deployment, and operations.
> - All diagram `.mmd` placeholders are created in `docs/diagrams/A01/`:
>   - architecture.mmd
>   - coordination_workflow.mmd
>   - integration_flow.mmd
>   - exec_overview.mmd
>   - deployment_timeline.mmd
> - The main report already contains hooks for these diagrams and TODO placeholders for dual-audience content.
> - Goal is to **build the full A01 report as one continuous document** in `report_A01.md` following `ctx_doc_style.md` rules.
> - **Split into part files only if** the content exceeds size/readability limits — e.g., 1000–1500 lines per file.
> 
> ### ACTION
> 1. **Work in `docs/reports/A01/report_A01.md` first**:
>    - Fill every placeholder with full technical details **and** a business/stakeholder summary.
>    - Embed diagrams directly from `.mmd` files under the appropriate section.
>    - Include:
>      - Architecture Overview with diagram
>      - Coordination Workflow (Terraform → Ansible) with diagram
>      - Deployment Guide with pre-deployment checklist, step-by-step phases, validation steps, and Gantt diagram
>      - Security Integration Flow with sequence diagram
>      - Executive Overview diagram for business audiences
>    - All sections must have dual-audience bullets and follow `ctx_doc_style.md` formatting.
> 
> 2. **Populate `.mmd` diagram files** with real diagrams:
>    - `architecture.mmd`: detailed infra topology
>    - `coordination_workflow.mmd`: infra → config flow with dependencies
>    - `integration_flow.mmd`: IAP + FreeIPA + NFS sequence
>    - `exec_overview.mmd`: simplified stakeholder view
>    - `deployment_timeline.mmd`: optimized Gantt with parallel tasks
> 
> 3. **Keep it continuous**:
>    - Treat the document as a flowing narrative from overview → deep dive → deployment → operations → appendices.
>    - Don’t scatter content across files unless it becomes too large.
>    - If you must split:
>      - Part 1: Architecture & Security
>      - Part 2: Deployment & Operations
>      - Maintain logical continuity and cross-link between parts.
> 
> 4. **Final checks**:
>    - Comply with `ctx_doc_style.md`: YAML front matter, `---` section separators, single detail per `###`, fenced mermaid indented 2 spaces, bullets only.
>    - Ensure terminology matches existing glossary.
>    - Avoid repeating identical text between main and part files — main should be condensed if parts exist.
> 
> 5. **Commit plan**:
>    - First commit: `.mmd` diagrams populated
>    - Second commit: `report_A01.md` filled with complete unified content
>    - Third commit (only if needed): Split into part files, adjust main to reference them
> 
> 
> **Execution order**:
> 1. Read Memory Bank + A01 scaffolding in `report_A01.md`
> 2. Fill diagrams (`docs/diagrams/A01/*.mmd`)
> 3. Populate main report in one pass
> 4. Evaluate length; split if necessary, keep continuity

## 7. User Prompt

> okay, merge all @report_A01_part01_architecture.md @report_A01_part02_deployment.md @report_A01_part03_operations.md @report_A01.md into 1 master file and pieces if it exceed 1000 rows please;
> 
> Remember that for start page. it's for stakeholder so write it in business pov; while for technical detail; write into Network setting; Security settings...
