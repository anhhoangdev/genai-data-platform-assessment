# Phase 1: planning

## 1. User Prompt

> # Mode: PLAN
> 
> You are my Senior Data Architect and Platform Engineer mentor.
> 
> I am starting **Task A01 – GCP Data Platform Foundation**.
> The requirement is to design and document a **VM-based** GCP Data Platform for a Data Engineering team (20–30 engineers), using:
> 
> - **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
> - **Ansible** for configuration management
> - **FreeIPA** for centralized authentication
> - **NFS** (GCP Filestore) for shared storage
> - **GCP services**: Compute Engine, VPC, IAM, Filestore
> 
> ### My background:
> I am experienced with Kubernetes-native platforms: containerized workloads, dynamic scaling, Kubernetes RBAC, object storage like S3/MinIO.
> This task is different — it uses **persistent VMs**, **shared NFS storage**, and **OS-level authentication** with FreeIPA.
> I want to map these concepts to my Kubernetes experience so I can design effectively.
> 
> ### Your tasks now:
> 1. **Explain** the requirement clearly and contrast it with Kubernetes-native architecture so I can mentally align concepts.
> 2. **Propose** an optimal architecture for 20–30 engineers, with all GCP components listed.
> 3. **Recommend** a Terraform module + variable structure for this setup.
> 4. **Outline** an Ansible automation plan for:
>    - FreeIPA client install/config on all VMs
>    - NFS mount setup with correct permissions
> 5. **Provide** an initial text-based infrastructure diagram and access control model.
> 6. **List** a high-level, step-by-step deployment plan.
> 
> We will stay in **Plan mode** until I approve the design and IaC structure.
> Once approved, we will switch to **Act mode** to start implementation.
> 
> Let’s begin by explaining the requirement in detail and mapping it to Kubernetes-native concepts.

## 2. User Prompt

> # Mode: PLAN
> 
> I want you to focus deeply on the **networking** and **scaling mechanisms** in Task A01’s VM-based design.
> I already understand the distributed motivation of Kubernetes — multiple nodes sharing workloads via a scheduler, service discovery, and dynamic scaling — but I do **not** fully understand what “distributed” means in this VM-based GCP platform.
> 
> Please explain:
> 
> 1. **Networking model**
>    - How traffic flows between bastion, FreeIPA server, worker VMs, and Filestore.
>    - How GCP VPC subnet segmentation works here.
>    - Role of firewall rules, private DNS, and Cloud NAT in internal and external communication.
>    - Equivalent mental mapping to Kubernetes service networking and NetworkPolicies.
> 
> 2. **Scaling model**
>    - How scaling is handled with Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) in this setup.
>    - What “distributed” means here:
>      Is it *only* a shared filesystem with NFS so all VMs see the same files,
>      or is there *also* distributed compute happening (e.g., a job runner, batch system)?
>    - How MIG scaling policies differ from Kubernetes HPA, and how workloads get distributed (manual job scheduling? round-robin SSH? external orchestrator?).
> 
> 3. **Distributed work in VM terms**
>    - Examples of scenarios where these VMs *truly* share and balance compute workloads.
>    - Cases where the system is just centralized storage + independent VM jobs.
>    - How a data engineering team would practically use this — e.g., engineers SSH into any worker VM, access the same NFS, and run jobs manually or via a job orchestrator (Airflow, etc.).
> 
> 4. **Constraints and trade-offs**
>    - Why we *can’t* get the same elasticity as Kubernetes here.
>    - Network latency and throughput limits in GCP VPC/Filestore compared to pod-to-pod networking and CSI in Kubernetes.
>    - Operational overhead differences (patching, VM lifecycle vs. container redeploys).
> 
> Goal: Give me a crystal-clear mental model so I can map Kubernetes distributed patterns to what’s *actually* happening in this persistent VM + NFS + FreeIPA design.

## 3. User Prompt

> **Current understanding:**
> 
> * The environment will be entirely VM-based (no Kubernetes).
> * VPC will have segmented subnets (services, workloads, storage).
> * Bastion VM will be the only SSH entry point (via IAP or VPN).
> * FreeIPA will handle Kerberos/LDAP authentication and DNS.
> * NFS (Filestore) will be mounted on all VMs for shared storage.
> * Terraform will provision the infra, Ansible will configure FreeIPA + NFS.
> * Day-2 ops will involve OS patching, FreeIPA user mgmt, and NFS ACL updates.
> 
> **My concern / priority:**
> Before creating **any** VM or attaching shared storage, I want to:
> 
> 1. **Design and provision the secrets infrastructure**:
> 
>    * Use **Secret Manager** (optionally CMEK with Cloud KMS) for FreeIPA admin pwd, Ansible vault pwd, SSH seeds, etc.
>    * Ensure CI/CD retrieves short-lived secrets at runtime via **Workload Identity Federation (WIF)**.
>    * No hardcoded secrets or service account keys.
> 2. **Lock down network access (firewalls) early**:
> 
>    * Deny-by-default VPC firewall posture.
>    * Allow only IAP/VPN ingress to bastion.
>    * Allow only specific ports between subnets (SSH, Kerberos, LDAP, NFS).
>    * Explicit firewall rules for Filestore and FreeIPA.
> 3. **Enable APIs and IAM bindings first** so later Terraform modules can work without elevated privileges in CI runtime.
> 
> **Request:**
> 
> * Act as if you are designing for **a security-critical production system**.
> * Explain, step-by-step, **how to set up the secret vaulting and firewall baseline before any VM creation**.
> * Include Terraform module structure for this “Phase 0” (secrets + firewall + IAM + API enablement).
> * Compare this to how a similar setup would be done in Kubernetes (so I can map my mental model).
> * Output should be modular, production-ready, and reproducible.
> * Confirm me if i'm misunderstanding something

## 4. User Prompt

> # Mode: IMPLEMENT — Phase-0 Bootstrap (GCP)
> 
> You are to generate a Terraform project for **Phase-0 foundation** of a secure GCP data platform.
> 
> ## Goals
> - Runs end-to-end in **one terraform apply** with no manual fixes.
> - Keeps IAM **least-privilege** but enough for bootstrap.
> - Defers service-dependent configs (Filestore exports, FreeIPA DNS) to Phase-1.
> - Produces **Terraform code**, **GitHub Actions workflow**, **README**, and a **Mermaid diagram**.
> 
> ## Deliverables
> 1. **Terraform code files** in correct directory structure:
> ```
> 
> terraform/
> modules/
> apis/
> iam\_service\_accounts/
> wif/
> kms/
> secrets/
> network/
> vpc/
> firewall/
> nat/
> dns/
> envs/dev/
> main.tf
> variables.tf
> outputs.tf
> backend.tf
> 
> ```
> 2. **Minimal GitHub Actions workflow**:
> - `terraform plan` on PR
> - `terraform apply` on merge to `main`
> - Uses Workload Identity Federation (no JSON keys)
> 3. **README.md** containing:
> - Apply order
> - What’s deferred to Phase-1
> - How to tighten IAM post-bootstrap
> - Mermaid diagram of Phase-0 resources
> 4. **Mermaid diagram** (in README) showing resource relationships:
> - APIs → IAM → WIF → Secrets
> - KMS → Secrets
> - Network → Subnets → Firewall/NAT
> - DNS private zone
> 
> ## Sequence to Implement
> 1. **APIs**: Enable
> ```
> 
> serviceusage
> cloudresourcemanager
> iam
> iamcredentials
> sts
> secretmanager
> cloudkms
> compute
> dns
> file
> iap
> logging
> monitoring
> 
> ```
> 2. **Terraform GSA**:
> - Name: `tf-cicd@<PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
> - Roles (project-level):
>   - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`
>   - `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`
>   - `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin`
>   - `roles/secretmanager.admin` (temporary)
>   - `roles/cloudkms.admin` (temporary)
>   - `roles/compute.networkAdmin`
>   - `roles/dns.admin`
> - WIF Binding:
>   - GitHub OIDC provider
>   - Scoped to repo + branch condition
>   - Role: `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` (resource-level on GSA)
> 3. **KMS (CMEK)**:
> - Regional keyring + symmetric key (rotate ~90 days)
> - Grant Secret Manager SA `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter`
> 4. **Secret Manager**:
> - CMEK-backed secrets:
>   - `freeipa-admin-password`
>   - `ansible-vault-password`
>   - `ipa-enrollment-otp`
> - Labels applied
> - CI WIF principal → `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`
> 5. **Network**:
> - VPC `vpc-data-platform`
> - Subnets:
>   - `services` (bastion, FreeIPA later)
>   - `workloads` (MIG workers later)
> - Firewall:
>   - Deny-all (priority 65534) for tag `vm-managed`
>   - Allow rules for:
>     - IAP → bastion (tcp:22)
>     - Bastion → workers (tcp:22)
>     - Placeholder FreeIPA ports (tcp/udp:53, tcp:88, tcp:389, tcp:443)
> - Cloud NAT for private egress
> 6. **DNS**:
> - Private zone `corp.internal.`
> - No FreeIPA forwarding yet (Phase-1 task)
> 
> ## Constraints
> - Each module outputs what the next needs (e.g., GSA email, KMS key name).
> - Use `depends_on` where ordering is required.
> - Defaults should work in a fresh project; make env/project/region configurable.
> - Mark Phase-1 TODOs in comments.
> 
> ## Output Format
> - **Terraform code** in directory structure above
> - **GitHub Actions workflow** for CI/CD
> - **README.md** with:
> - Apply order
> - Deferred Phase-1 items
> - IAM tightening steps
> - Mermaid diagram block showing resource flow

## 2. User Prompt

> Feedback on current plan:
> 
> ✅ Security model: no public IPs, IAP SSH, Shielded VMs, least-priv SAs per role, Secret Manager fetch at runtime — keep this.
> 
> ✅ Identity: FreeIPA central auth + sudo groups — correct.
> 
> ✅ Storage: Filestore /export/home & /export/shared with autofs — correct.
> 
> ✅ MIG scaling: instance template, CPU-based autoscale, health check on SSH — correct.
> 
> ⚠ Ansible connection path: must run from bastion or configure ProxyJump over IAP in inventory.
> 
> ⚠ DNS: Use Cloud DNS authoritative; disable IPA DNS; add _kerberos and _ldap SRV records in private zone.
> 
> ⚠ Secret scope: bind IAM per secret to FreeIPA/workstation SAs.
> 
> ⚠ autofs: enable pam_mkhomedir so NFS home is seeded on first login.
> 
> ⚠ Per-user services: code-server & Jupyter systemd units should be in /etc/skel so new users inherit them; enable linger.
> 
> ⚠ Firewall: verify NFS (2049) and Kerberos/LDAP ports are explicitly allowed; deny-all remains first.
> 
> Guidance — what to produce next:
> 
> Terraform modules under terraform/modules/:
> 
> bastion, freeipa_vm, filestore, instance_template_workstation, mig_workstation, dns_records.
> 
> All with Shielded VM config, no public IP, metadata startup script hooks, and outputs for IP/DNS.
> 
> Env wiring in terraform/envs/dev/phase1.tf:
> 
> Instantiate modules, pass outputs from Phase-0 (subnets, network, project, secret names).
> 
> Create SAs for bastion, FreeIPA, workstations; bind them to secrets.
> 
> Create DNS SRV records for Kerberos/LDAP pointing to FreeIPA.
> 
> Variables in terraform/envs/dev/variables.phase1.tf:
> 
> machine types, zones, MIG sizes, Filestore tier/capacity, realm/domain, hostnames, tags.
> 
> Ansible in ansible/:
> 
> Inventory grouping (bastion, freeipa, workstations) with ProxyJump config for workers.
> 
> Roles: common-base, freeipa-server, freeipa-client, nfs-client, panel-code-server, panel-jupyterlab.
> 
> Ensure autofs and pam_mkhomedir are configured.
> 
> Place panel unit files in /etc/skel/.config/systemd/user/ and enable linger.
> 
> Scripts in scripts/:
> 
> broker_select_vm.sh, iap_tunnel_code.sh, iap_tunnel_jupyter.sh — pick MIG instance, tunnel to panel ports.
> 
> Docs in docs/:
> 
> phase1_arch_diagram.mmd and phase1_access_flows.mmd (Mermaid).
> 
> Update README.md with Phase-1 apply steps, tunnel usage, troubleshooting.
> 
> Execution style:
> 
> Keep IAM least privilege: only grant needed roles to each SA; bind Secret Manager access at secret level.
> 
> Do not include any secrets or secret values in Terraform code; only names and IAM bindings.
> 
> Assume OS = Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for all VMs.
> 
> Keep configs reproducible; parametrize zones, sizes, and realm/domain in variables.
> 
> Ensure all firewall rules are explicit and minimal.

> ## FOLLOW-UP TASK: Populate A01 Documentation as Unified Report
> 
> ### CONTEXT
> - Current repo has `docs/reports/A01/report_A01.md` as main entry point with part files for architecture, deployment, and operations.
> - All diagram `.mmd` placeholders are created in `docs/diagrams/A01/`:
>   - architecture.mmd
>   - coordination_workflow.mmd
>   - integration_flow.mmd
>   - exec_overview.mmd
>   - deployment_timeline.mmd
> - The main report already contains hooks for these diagrams and TODO placeholders for dual-audience content.
> - Goal is to **build the full A01 report as one continuous document** in `report_A01.md` following `ctx_doc_style.md` rules.
> - **Split into part files only if** the content exceeds size/readability limits — e.g., 1000–1500 lines per file.
> 
> ### ACTION
> 1. **Work in `docs/reports/A01/report_A01.md` first**:
>    - Fill every placeholder with full technical details **and** a business/stakeholder summary.
>    - Embed diagrams directly from `.mmd` files under the appropriate section.
>    - Include:
>      - Architecture Overview with diagram
>      - Coordination Workflow (Terraform → Ansible) with diagram
>      - Deployment Guide with pre-deployment checklist, step-by-step phases, validation steps, and Gantt diagram
>      - Security Integration Flow with sequence diagram
>      - Executive Overview diagram for business audiences
>    - All sections must have dual-audience bullets and follow `ctx_doc_style.md` formatting.
> 
> 2. **Populate `.mmd` diagram files** with real diagrams:
>    - `architecture.mmd`: detailed infra topology
>    - `coordination_workflow.mmd`: infra → config flow with dependencies
>    - `integration_flow.mmd`: IAP + FreeIPA + NFS sequence
>    - `exec_overview.mmd`: simplified stakeholder view
>    - `deployment_timeline.mmd`: optimized Gantt with parallel tasks
> 
> 3. **Keep it continuous**:
>    - Treat the document as a flowing narrative from overview → deep dive → deployment → operations → appendices.
>    - Don’t scatter content across files unless it becomes too large.
>    - If you must split:
>      - Part 1: Architecture & Security
>      - Part 2: Deployment & Operations
>      - Maintain logical continuity and cross-link between parts.
> 
> 4. **Final checks**:
>    - Comply with `ctx_doc_style.md`: YAML front matter, `---` section separators, single detail per `###`, fenced mermaid indented 2 spaces, bullets only.
>    - Ensure terminology matches existing glossary.
>    - Avoid repeating identical text between main and part files — main should be condensed if parts exist.
> 
> 5. **Commit plan**:
>    - First commit: `.mmd` diagrams populated
>    - Second commit: `report_A01.md` filled with complete unified content
>    - Third commit (only if needed): Split into part files, adjust main to reference them
> 
> 
> **Execution order**:
> 1. Read Memory Bank + A01 scaffolding in `report_A01.md`
> 2. Fill diagrams (`docs/diagrams/A01/*.mmd`)
> 3. Populate main report in one pass
> 4. Evaluate length; split if necessary, keep continuity
