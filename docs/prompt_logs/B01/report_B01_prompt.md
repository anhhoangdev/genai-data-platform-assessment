# Formatted Prompt Log

## 1. User Prompt

> TEACH: Explain what a vector database is in plain language, with a real-world analogy. Then Give me 5 practical use cases for vector databases across different industries. And finally compare vector databases to traditional relational and NoSQL databases in one table.

## 2. User Prompt

> TEACH: List 5 popular vector databases with their main strengths and weaknesses.  Create a feature comparison table for Milvus, Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant, and Vespa. Suggest which vector DB would fit best for a small startup vs. an enterprise-scale AI product.

## 3. User Prompt

> TEACH: Explain the chosen tool’s architecture (components, data flow) with a diagram and plain-language explanation. Describe available index types, their trade-offs, and when to use each. Provide a “common pitfalls” list for using this tool in production. Create an exercise for setting up a minimal working example using this tool locally.

## 4. User Prompt

> TEACH: List best practices for data preparation, embedding normalization, and index selection.  Explain query tuning parameters (e.g., nlist, nprobe for IVF; ef_search for HNSW) and how they impact performance. Suggest a monitoring approach for tracking performance, recall, and latency in production. Provide an optimization exercise where the learner improves performance for a slow-running vector search.

## 5. User Prompt

> TEACH: Create a complete, self-contained documentation for B01 – Vector Database Tutorial in simple, direct, plain language.
> This should be suitable for both self-study and team knowledge sharing.
> 
> Follow this structure exactly:
> 
> 1. **Introduction**
>    - Define what a vector database is and why it exists
>    - Use plain language, analogies, and real-world examples
>    - Include at least 5 practical use cases across different industries
> 
> 2. **Tool Comparison**
>    - List 5 popular vector databases (Milvus, Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant, Vespa)
>    - Create a feature comparison table (license, hosting model, scalability, index types, ecosystem integration)
>    - Provide scenario-based recommendations for each tool
> 
> 3. **Deep Dive Analysis**
>    - Choose one tool (Milvus) and explain its architecture with a diagram
>    - Describe its main components and data flow in plain language
>    - List and explain available index types, trade-offs, and when to use each
>    - Provide a “Common Pitfalls” section for production usage
>    - Include a “Try This” exercise for setting up a minimal local instance
> 
> 4. **Implementation Guidance**
>    - Step-by-step setup instructions (Docker or managed)
>    - Python example for inserting and searching embeddings
>    - Hybrid search example (metadata + vector)
>    - A mini project idea for learners to practice
> 
> 5. **Best Practices**
>    - Data preparation and embedding normalization tips
>    - Index and query tuning guidelines
>    - Scaling and monitoring strategies
>    - Optimization checklist
> 
> 6. **Learning Reinforcement**
>    - 3 beginner exercises
>    - 3 intermediate exercises
>    - 2 advanced exercises
>    - Self-check questions and expected outcomes
> 
> 7. **Appendices**
>    - Glossary of vector database terms
>    - Quick reference cheat sheet
>    - Additional resources (blogs, videos, official docs)
> 
> Style rules:
> - Always explain “why” before “how”
> - Add inline comments in all code examples
> - Keep language accessible but technically accurate
> - Use bullet points, tables, and diagrams where helpful
> - Include “Common Pitfalls” and “Try This” boxes
> - Ensure all code examples are tested and correct
> 
> Output as a single Markdown document with proper section headings (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections).
