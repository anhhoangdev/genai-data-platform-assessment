# Active Context

- Current focus: A01 Phase-1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE; production hardening applied; documentation required for final deliverable
- Major milestone achieved: Complete end-to-end GCP Data Platform with VMs, FreeIPA authentication, NFS storage, and operational scripts
- Current state: Production-ready infrastructure with recent fixes (A-F) for IAP access, NFS bootstrapping, FreeIPA enrollment automation, dynamic inventory
- Deliverable (next): Complete A01 architecture documentation to meet enterprise handoff requirements
- Technical readiness: Full VM stack operational, IAP tunneling working, autofs NFS mounts configured, FreeIPA enrollment automated

## Recent Production Fixes Applied
- **IAP IAM bindings** for bastion access with Google Groups
- **Filestore bootstrap role** for directory structure and permissions
- **NFS autofs maps** corrected to use `/export/` paths with pam_mkhomedir
- **FreeIPA enrollment automation** with OTP rotation to Secret Manager
- **Dynamic GCE inventory** for Ansible workstation targeting
- **Deterministic IAP tunneling** scripts replacing random selection
