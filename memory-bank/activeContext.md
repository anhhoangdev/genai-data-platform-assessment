# Active Context

- Current focus: B01 VECTOR DATABASE TUTORIAL - TEACH mode implementation with step-by-step educational content
- Major milestone achieved: Complete A01 GCP Data Platform + A02 scalable compute with Cloud Composer and Dataproc
- Current state: Production-ready infrastructure with ephemeral compute capabilities and comprehensive documentation
- Deliverable status: A01 and A02 complete with all Terraform, Airflow, and documentation artifacts. B01 tutorial framework established.
- Implementation highlights: Private-IP Composer, ephemeral Dataproc+Dask, NFS/GCS integration, cost-optimized architecture
- New capability: TEACH mode added to PLAN/ACT system for educational content creation

## Recent Production Fixes Applied
- **IAP IAM bindings** for bastion access with Google Groups
- **Filestore bootstrap role** for directory structure and permissions
- **NFS autofs maps** corrected to use `/export/` paths with pam_mkhomedir
- **FreeIPA enrollment automation** with OTP rotation to Secret Manager
- **Dynamic GCE inventory** for Ansible workstation targeting
- **Deterministic IAP tunneling** scripts replacing random selection

## A02 Implementation Details
- **Terraform Modules**: Created `composer` and `dataproc` modules with private IP configurations
- **Phase 2 Configuration**: `terraform/envs/dev/phase2.tf` with service accounts and resources
- **Airflow DAGs**: Two patterns - ephemeral basic and autoscaling for production workloads
- **Python Jobs**: `dask_yarn_example.py` and `dask_large_scale_processing.py` with adaptive scaling
- **Storage Integration**: Dual support for Filestore NFS mounts and GCS via Private Google Access
- **Security Model**: WIF authentication, no SA keys, CMEK encryption, private IPs only

## Documentation Status
- **A01 Complete**: Master report, technical deep-dive, diagrams, and prompt logs
- **A02 Complete**: Main report (`report_A02.md`) and architecture diagrams (`report_A02_diagram.md`)
- **Code Artifacts**: All Terraform, Python, and configuration files ready for deployment
- **Integration Verified**: A02 leverages A01's VPC, NAT, Filestore, and security patterns
