# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

- Date: 2025-08-08
- Status: Accepted

## Context
- Need a consistent approach to documenting architecture decisions for A01/A02/B01

## Decision
- Use ADR markdown files under `planning/decisions/` with incremental numbering

## Alternatives
- Embed decisions in reports only

## Consequences
- Clear audit trail; easier onboarding and review
